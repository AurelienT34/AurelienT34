### 📈 Crypto trading bots – Python

On my free time, I actively develop **Python-based trading bots** connected to Binance APIs.

## ✨ What I care about

- Clean, readable and maintainable code
- Understanding systems end-to-end
- Improving existing architectures rather than rewriting blindly
- Building things that actually run in production

---

> I build things for real-world usage and learning, not for commit graphs.
